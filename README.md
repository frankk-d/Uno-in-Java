# Java Uno
This is a personal project of mine to recreaete Uno in Java. The game features local pass-and-play functionality, where you pass the device that you are playing around to each person.
It is recommended to play with 2+ people! 
In the game, there are "special" cards in the form of question marks. Each card creates a unique event. Try to find them all!

To run the game, simply open up the project in the editor of your choice and click run.
